# Audio samples generator

This is a simple python script which uses the [Balcon cli app](https://www.cross-plus-a.com/pl/bconsole.htm) to generate audio samples using Microsoft Windows built-in voices.
Gui version of Balcon is available [here](https://www.cross-plus-a.com/pl/balabolka.htm)

## usage

It will generate audio samples inside the `samples` directory.
